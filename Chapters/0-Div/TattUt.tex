The present work evaluated the sorption strength of two sewage sludge biochars pyrolyzed at 700 \textdegree C to six perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCA). The sewage sludge feedstocks were Ullensaker sludge (ULS) containing PFAS-enriched wastewater from Oslo Airport, and digested sludge Lindum (DSL), the remaining fraction after anaerobic digestion of sludge biomass into bio-gas. Biochar from clean wood chips (CWC), a highly carbonaceous feedstock, was used to compare the relative sorption abilities between a clean substrate and that from sewage sludge feedstocks. Batch tests were prepared with ULS, DSL, and CWC biochars and different concentrations of spiked PFCAs. Both single-compound experiments and a cocktail of different PFCAs in both soil and with biochar only were tested to measure sorption attenuation, the sorption suppression effect that occurs in more complex systems. Ten-point biochar-water sorption isotherms and six-point soil-biochar-water isotherms using a sandy soil (1.3\% TOC) were generated. Pore size distribution was conducted for surface area and pore volume by research partners for the sewage sludge biochars that were determined by $\mathrm{CO_2}$ sorptometry for small pores (0.3-1.5 $nm$) and $\mathrm{N_2}$ sorptometry for large pores ($>1.5 nm$).

The overarching goal of the VOW project and S\o rmo's PhD is to develop "designer" biochar from pyrolysis of organic waste materials that have optimized binding properties as sorbents for various contaminants present in soil and water.

My work has been one part of the work of a larger team of research partners whose aim has been to publish a scientific paper.

The main hypothesis this thesis sought to test was whether biochar from sewage sludge could serve as equally efficient sorbents as biochar from clean wood chips.
