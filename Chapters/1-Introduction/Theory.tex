Quality controls notes:

Sample matrix refers to everything present in the sample except for the target analytes. 

Reagent blank contains no sample matrix and no analytes, only labeled IS to check contamination during the extraction protocol. The reagent blank is brought through the entire extraction protocol and analyzed in the same manner as the test samples. Contamination from test tubes, reagents or other introductions of contamination will show up on the instrument results from this quality control sample. If contaminated we know that it comes from the protocol and needs to be subtracted from the rest of the samples.
