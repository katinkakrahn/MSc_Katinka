Reagent blank (RB): "sample that does not contain the matrix, that is brought through the protocol and analyzed in the same manner as a test sample, used to assess any contamination or interference caused by e.g., reagents or sample tubes or introduced during any part of the measurement procedure"

Sample blanks: "mixture of any solvent(s) and/or reagent(s) that would be presented to the LC-MS/MS detector without the addition of the test compounds for analysis of a test sample and is analyzed to determine if it contributes to the measurement signal, used to determine any interferences caused by the reaction procedure and should be included in the validation process as well as during routine use of the method, does not contain matrix only IS"
