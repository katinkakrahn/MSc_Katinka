\section{Objectives}\label{sec:objectives}
The aim of this thesis has been to study whether biochar from various waste materials can be used as sorbents in remediation of PFAS-contaminated soil and water. The overall goal of this study was to test the degree to which sewage sludge-based biochars can be used as effective sorbents for PFAS in the remediation of contaminated water and soil. To achieve this, sub-goals were to:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Roman*]
    \item{Compare the relative abilities of sewage sludge biochars and clean wood chip biochars to sorb PFAS}
    \item{Identify possible sorption mechanisms of PFAS for biochar from different feedstocks}
    \item{Study the effects of perfluorinated carbon chain-length on PFAS sorption to sewage sludge biochar}
    \item{Study the attenuation effect of competing sorbates and the presence of soil on sorption, and to evaluate the effectiveness of sewage sludge biochars as sorbents in real-world conditions}
\end{enumerate}

To achieve these objectives, sorption isotherms were determined for biochar from three different feedstocks: raw sewage sludge, digested sewage sludge, and clean wood chips. Six perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCA) with increasing chain lengths from C5-C10 were selected for spiking the sorption isotherms, both individually and as mixtures of these compounds. To study sorption attenuation, isotherms with biochar only, and isotherms with biochar mixed with a sandy, low-\acrshort{TOC} soil, were prepared.

If successful, the recycling of sewage sludge will be a cost-effective method for limiting the spreading of PFAS in the environment, and serve as an alternative to sub-optimal waste treatment forms. Sewage sludge also has the potential to sequester carbon.

\subsection{Hypotheses}\label{sec:hypotheis}
The following are the hypotheses this research sought to test:  
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*]
    \item Biochar from clean wood chips is a stronger sorbent than sewage sludge biochars in PFAS-contaminated water and soil, due to its higher carbon-content and porosity
    \item The dominant sorption mechanism of PFCAs to sewage sludge biochars is electrostatic attraction
    \item Sorption increases with perfluorinated carbon chain-length
    \item Sorption of PFCAs to biochar is attenuated by the presence of soil and other PFCAs. 
\end{enumerate}
