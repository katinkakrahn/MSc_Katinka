\section{PFAS sorption in biochar-water batch tests}
In \cref{fig:sorption_isotherms}, the sorption isotherms are presented for PFPeA, PFHxA, PFHpA, PFOA, PFNA and PFDA to CWC, ULS and DSL. The points generated from the batch tests were interpreted with the Freundlich equation (\cref{eq:FreundlichLinear}). For all compounds, the sorption isotherm for ULS is visibly higher than DSL followed by CWC. The Freundlich sorption coefficients ($log~K_F$), linearity coefficients ($n$) and correlation coefficients ($r^2$) are presented in \cref{tab:summary_stats_single}. Sorption increases in the order, CWC \textgreater DSL \textgreater ULS, attributing the highest sorption to the sewage sludge biochars, somewhat unexpectedly. Possible reasons for the strong sorption by the sludge biochars will be discussed throughout this chapter. 

\cref{fig:sorption_isotherms_all} show sorption isotherms for the single-compound batch tests for CWC, ULS and DSL.
The Freundlich coefficients of PFPeA sorption to CWC were $log~K_F$ = x $\pm$ se; $n_F$ = x $\pm$ y ($r^2$ = w). The sorption coefficients are higher compared to literature values for $log~K_F$ of PFOA to activated char that are frequently around x-y (citation). The results were interpreted by fitting the points to the Freundlich equation (\cref{eq:FreundlichLinear}). 

Due to the novel experiments conducted in this thesis, literature partitioning coefficients for PFCAs of other sewage sludge biochars are non-existent (is that correct?). However, a comparison can be made between the $log~K_F$s found in this thesis and for commercially-produced activated carbons from other studies. The $K_F$-values for ULS, DSL and CWC found in this study were all in the same range as $K_F$ values from commercially-produced activated carbons tested in other studies
\citep{Kupryianchyk2016a} $log~K_F$ = 5.60 for AC
\citep{silvani2019can} $log~K_F$ = 4.74-5.42 for AC from coconut shells PFOA
\citep{hansen2010sorption} $log~K_F$ = 4.45 for AC PFOA
This is promising for the potential to replace non-renewable activated carbons with waste based biochars for environmental remediation in the field and at wastewater treatment plants.

Importance of nonlinearity and concentration interval achieved 
Comparison of KF across concentration magnitudes, conversion factor and why

\citep{Kupryianchyk2016b}: PFOA to biochar in natively contaminated soil was KF = 3.02plusminus 0.04 and 3.01 plus minus 0.01 (in micrograms). 

\subsection{Sorption mechanisms}
PFAS contains a highly hydrophobic perfluorinated tail, which suggests that hydrophobic interactions plays an important role for sorption. 
Both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions are found \citep{zhang2013sorption}. Previous studies conclude that hydrophobic interaction plays the most important role for sorption and that electrostatic interaction is secondary, indicated by sorption strength in a study by \cite{zhang2021sorption} who saw sorption increasing in the order PFBA $<$ PFBS $<$ PFOA $<$ PFOS 

\subsubsection{Effect of PFAS chain length}
For the three biochars conducted single-compound isotherms on, log K\textsubscript{d} increases linearly with fluorocarbon (CF) chain length (\cref{fig:chainlength}). Although the regression was not significant for CWC ($r^2$ = 0.64, p = 0.056), comparing the regression analyses all together suggest a positive relationship between $log~K_F$ and chain length. For every CF\textsubscript{2} moiety, hydrophobic interactions between condensed aromatic structures in the biochar matrix increases. This suggests that hydrophobic interactions is the dominant sorption mechanism over electrostatic interactions between the anionic carboxylate functional group and positively charged surfaces on the sorbent. In accordance with most previous studies \citep{Sorengard2019,higgins2006sorption}. 

For the short-chain compounds (PFPeA and PFHxA), the concentration range and  achieved is for some compounds only over one order of magnitude for $C_w$, in contrast to the desired concentration range over four orders of magnitude. Correlations are poor which results in higher standard errors and slopes that are unrealistic (PFHxA-DSL: n=1.22 and PFHpA-ULS: 1.08). Possible explanations for the poor correlations for PFPeA and PFHxA are poor affinity. In \cref{fig:CWC_isotherm} PFPeA, it appears that CWC sorption sites have been saturated since most points center around the same area, which means that CWC reaches sorption maximum at $~$4000 $\mu g~kg^{-1}$.  This indicates that CWC has the lowest affinity and capacity to sorb short-chain PFCAs. 

The batch tests were spiked at 10 concentrations where the lowest concentration was aimed at being close to the instrumental LOQ. Poor signals were achieved for most of these points and were removed from the data analysis to improve the certainty of the regression analysis. By doing this the concentration range was reduced . It is also possible that some of the SP2 points also have higher uncertainty as the PFHxA CWC isotherm is strongly determined by the lowest spike point, the rest of the points are widely scattered \cref{fig:CWC_isotherm}. The DSL-PFPeA isotherm only consists of four points (SP7-10) could be used for the regression due to higher analyzed filtrate concentrations than what was spiked due to analytical uncertainty \cref{fig:DSL_isotherm}.  

\citep{zhang2013sorption}: reports that sorption of PFASs onto raw sewage sludge from C5-C15 increases with increasing alkyl chain length, while for chain lengths 2-5 the opposite is seen.

\subsubsection{Effect of PFAS functional group}
\cite{du2014adsorption}: electr and hydry balance 
Perfluorinated sulfonic acid (PFSA) have been found to sorb substantially stronger than perfluorinated carboxylic acids \citep{zhang2013sorption,zhang2021sorption}. PFOS exhibits better sorption capacity than PFOA because the sulfonic acid is a stronger acid than carboxylic acid \citep{arvaniti2015review}

biochar surface is negatively charged \citep{Ahmad2014}, pfas have low pka due to being strong acids and will be negatively charged. For PFOA pKa is 0-3.80, subject to much debate \citep{Goss2009comment,ding2013physicochemical}. pKa decreases with increasing alkyl chain length, but is still lower than the relevant concentrations \citep{ding2013physicochemical}. The PFCAs investigated in this study will be negatively charged regardless given the filtrate pH of 7.1-7.4 (\cref{tab:pHcond}). Thus, all TCs experience electrostatic repulsion from the biochar surface which result in the lowest KFvalues for the shorter chain PFCAs (\cref{tab:summary_stats_single}). 

\subsection{Sorption non-linearity}
All isotherms experience sorption attenuation at increasing concentrations indicated by $n<1 $ (\cref{tab:summary_stats_single}, which is consistent with the Freundlich model and other studies where sorption to biochar sees n-values typically around 0.3-0.7 \citep{Cornelissen2005}. From other studies, Kf increases and nF decreases with decreasing O/C, H/C, and N/C ratios \citep{Cornelissen2005}. However, this study $K_F$ decreases with decreasing O/C, H/C, and N/C ratios, and no clear trend is seen for $n$. Meanwhile, it does seem like the nonlinearity coefficients for CWC are more stable with increasing chain lengths than ULS and DSL. Additionally, comparing $n$ across compound isotherms does not make sense due to different spike concentrations being used for each compound. 

\subsection{Competition}
Due to different spike concentration used for each compound in the cocktail, establishing quantitative trends for how chain length influences competition for sorption size is difficult. However, some conclusions can be drawn by looking at the overall trends. \cref{tab:competition} shows that $log~K_d$ decreases for all compounds in the presence of a mixture. $K_d$ changes the least for PFHxA and PFHpA (2.3 and 0.2 \% respectively) and may be attributed to lower spiked concentrations (330 and 117 \textmu g L\textsuperscript{-1}) for these compounds compared to the rest in \cref{tab:competition}. Competition is most profound for PFOA to CWC followed by PFDA for ULS and CWC (15.8, 10.0 and 10.6 \% respectively), which can be explained by the highest concentrations spiked for these compounds (1 953 and 3 830 \textmu g L\textsuperscript{-1}). It appears that sorption of PFNA is minimally influenced by competition between other compounds despite SC being in the higher range (1 409 \textmu g L\textsuperscript{-1}). $K_d$ for PFPeA is reduced by 8.2\% and is expected based on weaker sorption of short-chain compounds.

Expected: Attenuation factors, larger for short-chain than long chains which have greater sorption affinity.

\subsection{Sorbent elemental composition vs sorption}
Carbon content of the biochars follows the expected trend, CWC \textgreater ULS \textgreater DSL with 91.4\%, 29.6\% and 13.5\%, respectively (\cref{tab:SAPV}). Oxygen content was highest for DSL and ULS (61.4 and 57.1 \% respectively) compared to 5.5 \% for CWC. CWC has a low O/C and H/C ratio (\textless 1) whereas ULS and DSL have ratios \textgreater 1. A low H/C and O/C ratio is associated with a high degree of aromaticity/condensation and few functional groups. This shows that the CWC matrix is dominated by carbon whereas ULS and DSL are dominated by oxygen resulting in a highly hydrophobic surface. The proportion of elements other than C, O, H and N contained in the biochar matrices is significantly different lower for the clean wood biochar (1.4 \%) compared to the sludge biochars (10.9 and 23.2 \%), containing a greater mixture of other elements. Total elemental composition of the three biochars is given in \cref{appSec:elements}. 

The results from this study is in contrast to \cite{Hale2016} that reports that the sorption strength of organic compounds to biochar increases with decreasing biochar O/C and biochar H/C ratios. 

PFAS sorption to sludge enhanced with increasing calcium concentration in solution, divalent ions contribute to stronger sorption compared to monovalent ions due to ion bridging between negatively charged PFAS and biochar at low pH \citep{zhang2013sorption,arvaniti2014sorption,arvaniti2015review}. 

\subsection{Surface area and pore volume}
Biochar from clean wood chips had a specific surface area (SSA) of 323  m\textsuperscript{2} g\textsuperscript{-1} for large pores (\textgreater 1.5 nm, N\textsubscript{2}), $\sim$ 200 m\textsuperscript{2} g\textsuperscript{-1} higher than the ULS and DSL sludge chars (128 and 110  m\textsuperscript{2} g\textsuperscript{-1}, respectively) \cref{tab:SAPV}. SSA of small pores (0.4-1.5 nm, CO\textsubscript{2} sorption) was 600  m\textsuperscript{2} g\textsuperscript{-1} for CWC, $\sim$ six times higher than ULS and DSL (165 and 87  m\textsuperscript{2} g\textsuperscript{-1}, respectively). Pore volume for large and small pores were relatively similar across biochar types (within 0.1 and 0.15 cm\textsuperscript{3} g\textsuperscript{-1} respectively). Contrary to previous findings, surface area and pore volume does not correlate with higher sorption as CWC proved to be the weakest sorbent in this study. A lack of significant linear correlations between SSA and $K_d$ and PV and K\textsubscript{d} is not surprising due to few biochar samples (n=3). 

Pore size distribution is important for explaining sorption of PFAS of increasing chain lengths due to differences in molecular size. PFDA has a maximum diameter of 1.54 nm, and therefore experiences size exclusion for the small pores (0.5-1.5 nm) and can therefore only diffuse into the larger pores represented by N\textsubscript{2} (\textgreater 1.5 nm) (\cref{tab:molecsize}). Regardless of the critical separation at pore size greater/less than 1.5 nm, shorter chain PFCAs is expected to diffuse more easily into the pores than the larger compounds.  

\citep{Hale2016}: SA and sorption. name variables that showed the strongest correlation with log KF although r2 values were low. Maximum sorption occurs when the molecular dimensions of the PFAS congeners fit inside the pores called size exclusion. Size exclusion is particularly prominent for biochars that are dominated with small micropores, 

Are PFAS chains flexible?

\subsection{pH and conductivity}
pH varied little between all biochar-soil-water systems with an average pH of 7.18 \textpm 0.02. Conductivity was 39 \textpm 0.9 \textmu S cm\textsuperscript{-1}. Since the variance is low, pH and conductivity was not considered as factors that influence sorption of PFCAs. The conductivity of soil-water samples differed the most from the rest of the samples with a mean conductivity of 23 \textpm 0.05 \textmu S cm\textsuperscript{-1} versus a mean of 41 \textpm 0.9 \textmu S cm\textsuperscript{-1} for the biochar-water and biochar-soil-water samples. Complete pH and conductivity data is in \cref{appSec:misclab}.

\section{PFAS sorption in soil-biochar-water batch tests}
\subsection{Soil chemistry}
The soil used in the batch tests was characterized as a fine sand (0.1 to 0.3 mm) with 1.3 \% TOC (pH 5.38 \textpm 0.02, CEC 2.63 \textpm 0.06 meqv 100 g\textsuperscript{-1}). Total element concentrations and exchangeable ion concentrations are in \cref{appSec:elements}, \cref{apptab:soil}. The soil extraction showed no native target analytes present.

\subsection{Soil-BC interactions}
Most previous studies have reported a linear increasing trend between log Kd and chain length. However not for PFPeA, \citep{zhang2013sorption}, found in \citep{Sorengard2019}. and \citep{guelfo2013}  these studies are for sorption to organic matter.  Steric hindrance. 

\subsubsection{Difference in color of filtrate between batch tests}
Filter clogging and reduction in filter size, had to exchange filters during filtration, how this may impact results

\subsubsection{Field conditions representativeness}
Soil pH, sorption/desorption of PFAS
Protonation state of PFAS (pKa) unaffected at environmentally relevant pH’s
Leaching in acid soil not a problem, will increase sorption affinity of charged carboxyl to protonated BC surface
Alkaline conditions, liming?? 
    Depends on the dominating sorption mechanism
    Repulsion: functional groups, iron oxides, changes charge with pH?
    If hydrophobic interactions are dominating, sorption will likely not be affected

BC dose

Are the results representative of what goes on in real life? Sorption by shaking for 14 days represent an assumed equilibrium between PFCAs in the water and soil phase. A comparable situation in the field would be washing of the soil with large amounts of water such as during heavy rainfall. This will only be the case during occasional stormwater events and thus the results from this research could benefit from being supplemented with results from leaching tests using biochar mixed with soil. However, the relationship:

\begin{align}
    \frac{k_1}{k_2}
\end{align}

where \(k_1\) is the PFCA sorption (adsorption and absorption) rate and \(k_2\) is the PFCA desorption rate, where \(k_1>>k_2\), which indicates that sorption is many times higher, and in an equilibrium situation, sorption and desorption will be at steady state \citep{Cornelissen2005}.

\section{Quality control of laboratory analysis and uncertainty}
Standard concentration (but at least leads to underestimation of results)
\subsection{Spiking standard concentrations}
SPE and directly, why?

The pipettes used for making the PFCA dilutions were calibrated. The three pipettes were: 1) 2-10 mL, 2) 200-1000 \textmu L, and 3) 5-50 \textmu L. All pipettes were below the permitted coefficient of variation (CV = 0.3, 0.5, and 2 $\%$ respectively (\cref{appSec:misclab}, \crefrange{appTab:pip2-10}{appTab:pip5-50}).

Since the diameter of the centrifuge tube (30 mm) was larger than that of a volumetric flask and biochar was added prior to the dilution process, the final concentration of the sorbent-sorbate mixture may have a heightened inaccuracy. However, the volume of which 0.1 g biochar occupies can be considered insignificant due to the high absorptive capacity of biochar and small mass used. Therefore a set of 10 centrifuge tubes filled to 50 mL containing 0.1 g CWC were weighed to control the uncertainty of the final dilutions. The results from weighing show that the weight of 10 trials were not accurate but precise, which means that all samples were prepared with the same final volume even though this volume deviates from 50 mL (\cref{appTab:PPcentrifuge}).

\subsubsection{Filter blanks no significant difference}

\subsection{PFAS losses during laboratory analysis}
SPE protocol, many steps, many PP test tubes transfers, saturated PFAS-solutions, internal standard (dilutions had to disregard IS because too low concentration)

\citep{Lath2019labsorb}: 
Syringe filters: sorption of PFOA to centrifuge tubes and filter membranes. Sorption onto syringe surface: negligible due to short residence time (\textless 10 s). 74\% recovery from regenerated cellulose syringe filter. No improvement in recovery was seen when conditioning the syringe filters with phosphate solution or methanol. No trend between losses of PFOA on syringe filter and increasing spike concentrations. Centrifugation only is therefore advised if possible to avoid filtration losses. 

Test tubes: Greater recoveries from glass tubes than plastic, PP poorest recovery (55-68 \% recovery)... Contact time of PFAS residing in tubes for longer than 7 days should not be of significance, as \citep{Lath2019labsorb} propose that sorption and saturation of tube walls occur within hours. 74-81 \% recovery for PP when testing dependence on pH and ionic strength. Slight pH dependence, higher recovery at higher pH due to repulsion of negatively charged functional groups (PP has negative surface charge above pH 3.5-4. Bridging effect will be observed at higher pH's between cations like Ca2+, but is still considered negligible compared to the losses due to the physicochemical properties of the materials themselves. In general PP and plastics consists of mainly carbon hydrogen chains and are more hydrophobic than glassware. Sorption to tube walls saturate, so recoveries increase significantly with higher spike concentrations (e.g. for PP, 12-415 ug/L spiked PFOA increased recovery from 53.7-85.5 \%). Therefore, quantification of low concentrations may be subject to highest error, and in most cases will be an underestimation of dissolved concentrations. 

Use of PP test tubes, study
Higher probability of underestimating Cw for low-concentration samples because tube walls saturate – maximum number of sorption sites, there is a sorption maximum (Langmuir)

\subsection{Uncertainty}
\subsubsection{Batch tests}
Vel, du kan jo prøve å legge sammen alle de feilene. Det finnes jo forskjellige typer feilkilder i et stort forsøksoppsett. Det man ofte ser er at det er en eller to feil som er så store at de overskygger de andre. Da er det ikke noen vits å ta med alle de små. Feilen som ofte er størst er reproduserbarhet av metoden. Altså forskjellen mellom for eksempel prøver laget i triplikater. Det du kan gjøre i oppgaven din er jo å kort diskutere feilkildene du har og identifisere de største og viktigste.
