%\subsubsection{PFCA standards}
%Another source of error could be the homogeneity of the PFAS standards. If the standards were not shaken (vortexed) properly before pipetting, the PFAS solution could be unevenly dissolved and thus cause inconsistent concentrations pipetted into each centrifuge tube. This can be particularly significant for the long-chain PFCAs which are less soluble than the short-chain ones. 

%What we did to overcome this, analyzed the standards themselves and compared with calculated concentrations.
