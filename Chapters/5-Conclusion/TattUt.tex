Thus, another hypothesis was generated from this thesis: the predominant sorption mechanism for PFAS is a low SA/PV ratio and a higher  
Determining iron speciation for sewage sludge biochars could have made for an interesting discussion because wastewater treatment plants often use iron and aluminum-based precipitating chemicals, so the biochar is expected to contain high amounts of Fe and Al, where how their speciation ends up after pyrolysis per today is unknown.
