\chapter{Recommendations for further work}\label{chap:furtherwork}

This thesis has developed a mechanistic understanding of the sorption of six PFCAs to three biochars by spiking water with known concentrations of individual PFCAs and cocktails. Future work should look more into relating this work to field-scale applications, real-life relevance. Include your idea with finding an attenuation factor for soils of increasing \%TOC to adjust the dose biochar needed to reduce PFAS pore water concentration to EQS levels. 

Multivariate regression with many chars to determine biochar properties that best contribute to sorption.
